HKGA is a bad file encryptor.
and i stole the libraries of other aka AES to make my project.
its written in python (becouse im bad).
(around 60% just AI)
(BTW it wont work becouse you need like 20 libraries aka Crypto.Cipher and Crypto.Random)
it uses .hkga 
have fun :)
(btw VirusTotal tells you its a virus but thats a error you can look at the source code it is NOT a virus)
