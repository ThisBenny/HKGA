HKGA is a bad file encryptor.
and i stole the libraries of other aka AES to make my project.
its written in python (becouse im bad).
(around 60% just AI)
it uses .hkga 
have fun :)
(btw VirusTotal tells you its a virus but thats a error you can look at the source code it is NOT a virus)
by the side it is VERY esey to corrupt your files or maybe your whole system using this i will not take any Liability for any damage see LICENCE.txt

on linux you may need to run this command in the folder where you downloaded hkga: chmod +x hkga
on windows it should run out of the box

you need to open the file you want to encrypt with the hkga executeable otherwise it wont work as expected.
